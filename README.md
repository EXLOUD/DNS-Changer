## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

### Method 1: Using the Launcher (Recommended)
1. Download both files:
   - `Launcher.bat` (Automatic elevation and PowerShell detection)
   - `dns_changer.ps1` (Main DNS configuration script)
2. Place both files in the same directory
3. **Double-click** on `Launcher.bat` or **Right-click** and select "Run as administrator"
4. The launcher will automatically:
   - Request administrator privileges
   - Detect best PowerShell version
   - Launch the DNS configurator
5. Follow the interactive prompts

### Method 2: Direct PowerShell Execution
1. Download `dns_changer.ps1`
2. Open PowerShell **as Administrator**
3. Navigate to the script directory
4. Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`
5. Execute: `.\dns_changer.ps1`

## üéØ How It Works

### Step 1: Network Adapter Selection
- Displays all active network adapters
- Shows adapter names and descriptions
- Allows selection of specific adapter to configure

### Step 2: Current DNS Display
- Shows current DNS provider (automatically identified)
- Displays current DNS server addresses
- Indicates if using automatic (DHCP) configuration

### Step 3: DNS Provider Selection
- Lists all available DNS providers
- Shows primary and secondary DNS addresses
- Option to reset to automatic (DHCP)

### Step 4: Configuration Applied
- Sets new DNS servers on selected adapter
- Clears DNS cache for immediate effect
- Displays new configuration for verification

## üîß Technical Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11
- **PowerShell**: Version 5.1 or higher (automatically detected)
- **Privileges**: Administrator rights (automatically requested)
- **Network**: At least one active network adapter
- **Dependencies**: Native Windows PowerShell cmdlets only

## ü§ñ Automatic Features

### PowerShell Version Detection
The launcher automatically detects and uses the best available PowerShell:
1. **PowerShell 7 Preview** (modern features)
2. **PowerShell 7** (modern features)
3. **PowerShell 5.1** (Windows PowerShell - fallback)

### DNS Provider Identification
Automatically identifies current DNS provider by comparing server addresses:
- Exact matches for popular providers
- Partial matches when only one server configured
- Custom DNS detection for unknown configurations

### Administrator Privilege Management
- Checks current privileges before execution
- Automatically requests elevation if needed
- Uses best available PowerShell for elevation
